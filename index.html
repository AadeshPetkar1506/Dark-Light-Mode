            Cricket has been an established team sport for hundreds of years. It originated in its modern form in
            England and is most popular in the present and former members of the Commonwealth. Cricket is the second
            most popular sport in the world.[1] More than a hundred cricket-playing nations are recognized by the
            International Cricket Council.[2] In the countries of South Asia, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and
            Sri Lanka, cricket is the most popular sport. It is also a major sport in England and Wales, Australia, New
            Zealand, South Africa, Zimbabwe and the English-speaking countries of the Caribbean, which are collectively
            known in cricketing parlance as the West Indies. There are also well-established amateur club competitions
            in countries as diverse as the Netherlands, Kenya, Nepal and Argentina, among others.
